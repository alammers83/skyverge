		<section class="center">
			<h1>Welcome!</h1>
			<p>
				I have been doing technical support for 4 years.  I answer emails/tickets from customers and internal employees daily. This involvesed troubleshooting the app or android smartphone at Silent Circle and recently troubleshooting websites. I helped increase ticket resolution time and customer satisfaction ratings. I am customer service focused and enjoy assisting people in any way I can.
				I am currently training to do web development. I just finished an intro to programming Nano degree from Udacity and am working on front end web development from Udacity. I am on linkedin at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/amber-lammers">Amber Lammers</a> and you can find me on <a href="https://github.com/alammers83">github</a>.

					<h1>A day in the life:</h1>
					<p>
						Pre-sales: I would inform the customer we do not yet offer the feature and then highlight all the features we have that their current app does not. 
						Fire-Alarm: I would immediately investigate and confirm the issue. Then I would contact the appropriate engineering team to alert them of the issue in addtion to supervisors so they could disseminate the information. Lastly I would mass respond to the emails with hopefully a work around or ETA on the fix. 
						Step-by-step: The last thing I purchashed online was a tail light for my 2003 Civic. I googled '2003 tail light assembly'. Then I went through the search results for a website that sold the entire assembly. I ended up selecting Amazon. Before completing the purchase I checked the part number to make sure it would fit the OEM of my car.
